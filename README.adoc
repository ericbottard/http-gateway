= HTTP Gateway

This component allows the ingestion of messages over http into riff streams.

## Development
To create a deployment for the gateway, run
[source, bash]
----
make all
ko apply -f config/
----

Then, add a kubernetes service for the deployment created in `riff-system` as desired.

## Usage
This component accepts `POST` requests to the following URL patterns:
----
/<namespace>/<stream-name>
----

The body of the http request will be converted to the message payload,
using the http `Content-Type` header as the message content type. That MIME type
must be compatible (currently, strictly equal) as the stream declared `contentType`.
